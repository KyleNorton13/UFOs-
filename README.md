# UFOs-

## Overview of Project
  
The purpose of this challenge was to design a webpage for Dana on UFO sightings. Throughout the module we accomplished this by adding numerous features to the webpage, but the challenge expanded upon this. The goal was to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter multiple criteria at the same time. These filters included the date, city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results

The new webpage includes various features that were not previously on it throughout the module. This includes filters such as city, state, country and shape. The user can filter by date to see all sightings on a specific date. They can also see sightings by the city and state if they are looking for a specific place. The user would need to use the filter search box where they can enter their desired criteria to get the results they are looking for.
